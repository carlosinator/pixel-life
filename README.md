# pixel-life

In a far away land, many mountains and seas from here, life is only made of pixels...


(requires pygame)

## Procedural Generation
These are my first implementations in pixel land. For simplicity, the space is not infinite, but warps back onto itself.
To test an implementation, simply run its file.

## Plants and Animals
Currently, only the plants exist, but this already works. You can run the main and play around with the global parameters to see what happens.
