# Pixel Life

In a faraway land, many mountains and seas from here, life is only made of pixels...

## Procedural Generation
These are my first implementations in pixel land. For simplicity, the space is not infinite but warps back onto itself.
To test an implementation, simply run its file.

## Plants and Animals
Currently, only the plants exist, but this already works. You can run the main and play around with the global parameters to see what happens.

## Notes
- requires pygame
- let me know if you want to contribute :)
